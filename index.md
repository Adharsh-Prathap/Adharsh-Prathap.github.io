### CPSC 120

LAB 3

Lab 3 part 1 one was one of my favorite labs due to it being my first true introduction to the world of computer science. I enjoyed playing around with 
the mad lib aspect of the Lab and learning how to implement user input into my code. We also were introduced to formatting in this lab, which aided me 
in future labs, as formatting was a major part in every lab. 

LAB 5

I liked Lab 5 part 3 because I did not know how to play blackjack before this lab, and now I learned and got interested in the game to play with my friends.
It was also a lab that used a real life scenario that is common among most people, which allowed me to understand more deeply how computer science affects 
the real world. I also enjoyed implementing all the loops that we learned throughout the course. 

LAB 7

I enjoyed lab 7 part 1 because I liked creating functions that involved mathematical calculations. I also learned what a julian date was, which I had not 
known previous to working on this lab. I liked how we implemented two different mathematical functions in one main file to create a certain expected output 
depending on the input values.
